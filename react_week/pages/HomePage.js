            <h3>In the Gregorian calendar (today mostly in use), New Year’s Eve, the last day of the year, is on
                December 31.</h3>

            <h3> New Year’s Eve is all about numbers. Indeed, we spend the entire day counting down the hours until 11
                p.m., when we start counting the minutes, which we do until 11:59 p.m., when we start counting the
                seconds.</h3>

                <h3> December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2022 – New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are on a Frieday and
                    Saturday.</h3>

                    <h3> The International Date Line, located at 180 degrees longitude and on the exact opposite side of
                        the Earth of the prime meridian, denotes the passage of a calendar date from the day before. The
                        countries west of the line move into a new day first, and other countries (moving westward)
                        follow.</h3>
